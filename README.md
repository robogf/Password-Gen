Through this application we are able to generate a random password with the requirements that the user wants to select.

## Code Snippet 
``` JavaScript
 if (passLength<8||passLength>128){
    alert ('Please select a password length between 8 and 128 characters ')
    }
      else if (isNaN(passLength)){
        alert('Please enter a valid number')
      }// This prompt allows the user to pick the amount of characters for the password and has them enter valid answers
```
